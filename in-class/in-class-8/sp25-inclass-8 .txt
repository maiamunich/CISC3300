CISC 3300 S25 
In class assignment 8 
1. In certain programming languages the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, called the script, reads and executes the code. This is called an interpreted language. 
2. Type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime, this is called dynamic typing. 
3. The automatic conversion of values from one data type to another is called Type Juggling. 
4. Non-primitive data are mutable and hold references to objects stored in memory. 
5. Strict equal === Checks if two values are equal without type coercion. 
6. Create a webpage that has a JavaScript component. In that Javascript component: 
1. Add a string and a number together, console.log and explain the output.


When you add a number as a string, Javascript is not going to read the type and is going to convert the number to a string and then add them together, creating 158 




 2. Run the output of the Number() function twice, once with a true boolean and once with a false boolean, console.log and explain the output.
This is like a Boolean idea of using 1 and 0. So JavaScript is converting a ‘true’ to 1 and ‘false’ to 0  


3. Run the output of the Boolean() function on 1, 0, and a string “0”, console.log and explain the output. 
The Boolean is looking at 0 and 1. 0 is considered false and 1 is true, anything that isn't a 0 such as ‘0’ which is a string will be considered true because a non-empty string is true.  


4. Please take a screenshot of your browser console with the output from 1-3.
